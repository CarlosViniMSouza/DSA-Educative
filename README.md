## What are data structures?

Data structures are code structures for storing and organizing data that make it easier to modify, navigate, and access information. Data structures determine how data is collected, the functionality we can implement, and the relationships between data.

Data structures are used in almost all areas of computer science and programming, from operating systems, to front-end/back-end development, to machine learning, and others software development.
