# Linked lists in Python

[Linked lists](https://www.educative.io/blog/data-structures-linked-list-java-tutorial) are a sequential collection of data that uses **relational pointers on each data node** to link to the next node in the list.

Unlike arrays, linked lists do not have objective positions in the list. Instead, they have relational positions based on their surrounding nodes.

The first node in a linked list is called the **head node**, and the final is called the tail node, which has a `null` pointer.

Linked lists can be singly or doubly linked depending if each node has just a single pointer to the next node or if it also has a second pointer to the previous node.

## Applications:

- Building block for *advanced data structures*

- Solutions that call for frequent *addition and removal of data*

## Common linked list interview questions in Python:

- *Print the middle element* of a given linked list

- *Remove duplicate elements* from a sorted linked list

- Check if a singly linked list is a *palindrome*

- *Merge K sorted linked lists*

- *Find the intersection point* of two linked lists
