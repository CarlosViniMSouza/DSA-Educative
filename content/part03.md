# Stacks in Python

[Stacks](https://www.educative.io/blog/data-structures-stack-queue-java-tutorial) are a sequential data structure that act as the Last-in, First-out (LIFO) version of queues. The last element inserted in a stack is considered at the **top of the stack** and is the only accessible element. To access a middle element, you must first remove enough elements to make the desired element the top of the stack.

Many developers imagine stacks as a stack of dinner plates; you can add or remove plates to the top of the stack but must move the whole stack to place one at the bottom.

Adding elements is known as a **push**, and removing elements is known as a **pop**. You can implement stacks in Python using the built-in list structure. With list implementation, push operations use the `append()` method, and pop operations use `pop()`.

## Applications:

- Used for making highly reactive systems

- Memory management systems use stacks to handle the most recent requests first

- Helpful for questions like parenthesis matching

## Common stacks interview questions in Python

- Implement a *queue using stacks*

- *Evaluate a Postfix* expression with a stack

- Next greatest element using a stack

- Create a `min()` function using a stack
