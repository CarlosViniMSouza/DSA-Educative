# Trees in Python

[Trees](https://www.educative.io/blog/data-structures-trees-java) are another relation-based data structure, which specialize in representing hierarchical structures. Like a linked list, theyâ€™re populated with *Node* objects that contain a data value and one or more pointers to define its relation to immediate nodes.

Each tree has a *root* node that all other nodes branch off from. The root contains pointers to all elements directly below it, which are known as its *child nodes*. These child nodes can then have child nodes of their own. **Binary trees cannot have nodes with more than two child nodes**.

Any nodes on the same level are called *sibling nodes*. Nodes with no connected child nodes are known as *leaf nodes*.

## Applications:

- Great for storing hierarchical data such as a file location

- Used to implement top searching and sorting algorithms like binary search trees and binary heaps

## Common tree interview questions in Python

- *Check if two binary trees are identical*

- [Implement level order traversal of a binary tree](https://www.educative.io/blog/tree-traversal-algorithms)

- *Print the perimeter* of a binary search tree

- *Sum all nodes* along a path

- *Connect all siblings* of a binary tree
