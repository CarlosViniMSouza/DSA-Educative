# Graphs in Python

[Graphs](https://www.educative.io/blog/graph-algorithms-tutorial) are a data structure used to represent a visual of relationships between **data vertices** (the Nodes of a graph). The links that connect vertices together are called **edges**.

Edges define which vertices are connected but does not indicate a direction flow between them. Each vertex has connections to other vertices which are saved on the vertex as a comma-separated list.

Theyâ€™re primarily used to convey visual web-structure networks in code form. These structures can model many different types of relationships like hierarchies, branching structures, or simply be an unordered relational web. The versatility and intuitiveness of graphs makes them a favorite for [data science](https://www.educative.io/blog/python-pandas-tutorial).

## Applications:

- Excellent for modeling networks or web-like structures

- Used to model social network sites like [Facebook](https://www.educative.io/blog/cracking-top-facebook-coding-interview-questions)

## Common graph interview questions in Python

- *Detect cycle* in a directed graph

- *Find a "Mother Vertex"* in a directed graph

- *Count number of edges* in an undirected graph

- *Check if a path exists between two vertices*

- *Find the shortest path* between two vertices
